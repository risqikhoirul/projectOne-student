# change log
+ 2.4.10
  - added error handling
+ 2.3.9
  - the package now fully accepts text instead of only accepting files
  - uploadFileWithContent method added (upload file with text content)
  - insertOne method added only accepts text and not files
  - find method added returns all the messages in a given channel
  - findOne method added returns one message by id
  - updateOne method added updates one message contact by id (only works with text or files with text attached to them) can not update files
  - deleteMany method added deletes all the messages in the given channel (not recommended heavy request to discord API) recommended to use when the message is below 50 messages
  - deleteFileById method is now the deleteMessageById method (works for both files and text)
+ 1.2.8 
  - fix a bug, the id returned from the uploadFile method was the channel id, not the message-id (fixed)
  - added method deleteFileById (delete a file by message-id) much faster than deleteFileByURL and fewer requests to the discord API (in 2.3.9 this method will be renamed to deleteMessageById for supporting text messages)
    

# Installation

# Usage

## construct the class

```js
const DiscordDatabase = require("discord-cloud-database");

// the class constructor takes 2 arguments (return a new instance of the class)
//the first arg
/*
 *    The first argument is the token of the discord user (not the bot)
 * The first argument is optional and the default value  will be null
 */

// the second arg
/*
 *    The second argument is the channel id map (discord server channel id), a simple object that maps the channel id to the file name
 *
 *    used for not having to pass the channel id every time you want to upload a file only put the channel name
 *    The second argument is optional and the default value is {}
 */

/**
   * @param {Discord.Token} token - discord token user account
   * @param {Object} channelMapper - simple map to map the ids of the channels  ex:{product:'7459996657'}
   * @returns instant from the class
   * @example new DiscordDatabase("aw2waeaew",{
   *  products:'123365477',
   *  users: '8555665844'
   * })
   * @pre have discord user and server (join the user to server and make some channels) then you need to get the token of the user and the ids of the channel
   */
const discordDatabase = new DiscordDatabase(TOKEN, channelIdMap);
```

## methods

### uploadFile

```js
const DiscordDatabase = require("discord-cloud-database");
const discordDatabase = new DiscordDatabase(TOKEN?,channelIdMap?);

// uploadFile takes 3 arguments (return the uploaded file object)

// the first arg
/*
*    The first argument is the file (buffer | stream)
     file buffer is the file content saved in memory as a buffer
     file Stream is the file content saved in memory as a stream
        stream is useful when you want to upload a file that is too big to be saved in memory as a buffer
        usually when you want to upload videos or zip files
*    The first argument is required
*/

// the second arg
/*
*    The second argument is the file name (string)
      this is the name of the file that will be saved in the database
*    The second argument is required
*/

// the third arg
/*
*   The third argument is the channel (object)
      this is the channel that the file will be uploaded to
        the channel object has 2 properties
        name: the name of the channel in the channelIdMap
        id: the id of the channel
        when you pass the channel object you can pass only the name or only the id
        if you pass only the name the id will be taken from the channelIdMap
        if you pass only the id the id will be acquired
        if you pass both the id will be taken from the channel object
        not passing the channel object will result in an error by the discord API
*    The third argument is required to pass one of the 2 properties and the default value is { name: "", id: "" }
*/

// method return a promise
/*
*
    resolving the promise will return the file objects
        example of return value resolved object
        {

            width: 123, // the width of the image
            height: 123, // the height of the image
        }

### updateOne 
- work with messages containing text 
- message containing file only (not text) will result in an error 
- message containing file only must have a text to be updated

```js
const DiscordDatabase = require("discord-cloud-database");
const discordDatabase = new DiscordDatabase(TOKEN?,channelIdMap?);

### deleteMessageById 
- was called deleteFileById before version 2.3.9
- deleteFileById is now removed and replaced with deleteMessageById
```js
const DiscordDatabase = require("discord-cloud-database");
const discordDatabase = new DiscordDatabase(TOKEN?,channelIdMap?);

// deleteMessageById takes 2 argument

// the first arg
/*
*    The first argument is the file id (string) returned by the uploadFile method
*    The first argument is required
*/

// the second arg
/*
*    The second argument is the channel (object)
      this is the channel that the file will be deleted from
        the channel object has 2 properties
        name: the name of the channel in the channelIdMap
        id: the id of the channel
        when you pass the channel object you can pass only the name or only the id
        if you pass only the name the id will be taken from the channelIdMap
        if you pass only the id the id will be acquired
        if you pass both the id will be taken from the channel object
        not passing the channel object will result in an error by the discord API
*/

// method return a promise
/*
* resolving the promise will return true if the file is deleted successfully
*/

  /**

   * @returns {Boolean} true if success
   * @example call - await DiscordDatabase.deleteMessageById('5555555',{name:'users'})
   * @example return - true
   */
async deleteMessageById(fileId, channel = { name: "", id: "" })
```

### deleteFileByURL
- recommended using deleteMessageById instead

```js
const DiscordDatabase = require("discord-cloud-database");
const discordDatabase = new DiscordDatabase(TOKEN?,channelIdMap?);

// deleteFileByURL takes 1 argument

// the first arg
/*
*    The first argument is the file URL (string)
*    The first argument is required
*/

// method return a promise
/*
* resolving the promise will return true if the file is deleted successfully
*/

  /**
   * @param {String} fileURL - the file URL came from the uploadFile method
   * @param {Object} channel - Discord channel {id or name(if you put map to the constructor you can use the name only)}
   * @returns {Boolean} true if success
   * @example call - await DiscordDatabase.deleteFileByURL('https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/123/123/some-name.jpg',{name:'users'})
   * @example return - true
   */
async deleteFileByURL(fileURL)
```

### deleteMany
- not recommended to use this method (heavy load on the discord API)
- only use this method if you have less than 50 messages to delete
```js
const DiscordDatabase = require("discord-cloud-database");
const discordDatabase = new DiscordDatabase(TOKEN?,channelIdMap?);

// deleteMany takes 1 argument

// the first arg
/*
*    The first argument is the channel (object)
      this is the channel that the file will be deleted from
        the channel object has 2 properties
        name: the name of the channel in the channelIdMap
        id: the id of the channel
        when you pass the channel object you can pass only the name or only the id
        if you pass only the name the id will be taken from the channelIdMap
        if you pass only the id the id will be acquired
        if you pass both the id will be taken from the channel object
        not passing the channel object will result in an error by the discord API
*/

// method return a promise
/*
* resolving the promise will return true if the file is deleted successfully
*/

   /**
   * method to delete all messages in the channel.
   * @param {Object} channel - Discord channel {id or name(if you put map to the constructor you can use the name only)}
   * @example call - deleteMany({name:'products'})
   * @example {Boolean} return - true
   * @note - not recommended (heavy requests on discord API result in getting banned) only use on the low amount of data (50 messages recommended)
   */
async deleteMany(channel = { name: "", id: "" })
```

### login
- recommended using the login method instead of passing the token in the constructor
```js
const DiscordDatabase = require("discord-cloud-database");
const discordDatabase = new DiscordDatabase(TOKEN?,channelIdMap?);

// login take 2 argument

// the first arg
/*
*    The first argument is the email for the discord account (string)
*    The first argument is required
*/

// the second arg
/*
*    The second argument is the password for the discord account (string)
*    The second argument is required
*/

// method return a promise
/*
* resolving the promise will return {this} an instance of the class
*/

// this method is used to login to the discord account and obtain the token
// using this method will override the token passed in the constructor
// you can obtain the token from the class by using the token property discordDatabase.token

  /**
   * @param {String} email - discord email

# config with multer

when making an API that uploads files to the server you can use multer to handle the file upload
using multer memory storage to save the file in memory as a buffer
and then pass the file to the uploadFile method

this project is perfectly compatible with multer

```js
const multer = require("multer");
const DiscordDatabase = require("discord-cloud-database");

// in the middleware file
exports.multerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const multerStorage = multer.memoryStorage();
  return multer({
    storage: multerStorage,
  }).single("photo");
};
exports.uploadImageMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  const file = req.file;
  const image = await discordDatabase.uploadFile(
    file.buffer,
    file.originalname,
    { name: "users" }
  );
  req.image = image;
  next();
};

// in the route file
const { multerMiddleware, uploadImageMiddleware } = require("../middleware");

router.route("/").post(
  multerMiddleware,
  uploadImageMiddleware,
  catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
    res.status(200).json({
      status: "success",
      data: {
        image: req.image.url,
      },
    });
  })
);
```
# note
I recommend using multer memory storage to save the file in memory as a buffer
<br />
<br />
Also, recommend using the proxy_url of the uploaded file returned from uploadFile

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1070241455735590945/1070610371318136903/image.png)

to use on the web,
like HTML img tag src attribute with adding crossorigin="anonymous" to the img tag
```html
<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/xxx/xxx/file1" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

# the image uploaded to the server:

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1070241455735590945/1070559309764771901/image.png)

the returned URL of the image can be stored in the database

and there you have it a simple way to upload files to the server and store the URL in the database

the URL can be used to show images in the web apps or download the file (if the file is not an image) from discord servers

# limitations

- discord API rate limit
- max file size 8mb
- too much configuration to do
- the risk of getting banned from discord but the server with still there and you will not lose any data
- you can only use a 'discord user account' not a 'bot account'

# advantages

- free and unlimited storage
- easy to use
- no need to install any database
- some host services like Heroku don‚Äôt allow you to use the fs module to save files in the server this is solved by passing the file as a stream or buffer to the uploadFile method
- you can use the same discord account to upload files to different servers
